# Projects
 Various data analysis projects I've worked on
ExcelBike is the dashboard I made with dataset used from Alex the Analyst
BBNHllc is the dashboard I made for a local small business who was interested in looking at their income and expenses. I had created a couple basic tables with slicers for them, pivot tables, charts, etc-- for NDA reasons, I've only made the working page and dashboard available to view here.

I hope to get a little more variety up in this repository to show the different skills I've acquired, so stay tuned!
