# Projects

Various data analysis projects I've worked on:

## ** Microsoft Excel 
- ExcelBike is the dashboard I made with dataset used from Alex the Analyst
- BBNHllc is the dashboard I made for a local small business who was interested in looking at their income and expenses. I had created a couple basic tables with slicers for them, pivot tables, charts, etc-- for NDA reasons, I've only made the working page and dashboard available to view here.

## ** Microsoft PowerBI
- Sale Project is a Power BI project I worked on. I took 4 csv files, appended them into 1 query, created a schema (data model), then created a report will different visualizationsof the data. I took screenshots of the report pages, then pasted them into a jupyter notebook and wrote the project process in markdown also.

I hope to get a little more variety up in this repository to show the different skills I've acquired, so stay tuned!
